The basic front end Free Code Camp project. 

This project covers the Personal Portfolio basic front end challenge from Free Code Camp.

The web page must conform to a series of user stories which are as follows:

User Stories: 
•	I can access all the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
•	I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use           placeholders.) 
•	I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

In simple terms the portfolio is a single page website, where each of the sections can be accessed from a navigation bar.
